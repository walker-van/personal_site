    <h2>Statement</h2>
    <p>
        Over four years of materials engineering experience, I led product development and failure analysis across several material applications, including electronics glass and coatings, fungal biomaterials, cellular materials, steel, aluminum, titanium, and slag and industrial waste materials. I built statistical models to understand and evaluate product failure data, designed and trained a computer vision ML model to accelerate the iPhone's development cycle, de-risked a $100M project through a failure investigation, and won $300k of engineering work. I seek to create value through data-driven initiatives and developing technical products.

    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <h3>Materials Engineer (EIT) and Project Manager</h3>
    <h4>Ecomaterials Inc. and Insight R&D (Feb. 2023 - Present)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>I write project proposals to prospective clients (two were recently accepted for $150k each) </li>
        <li>Supported project planning and execution of a slag atomization pilot plant trial ($280k project) held over three weeks. Monitored the process, conducted data collection, data processing, analysis, and final report writeup ahead of schedule.</li>
        <li>Project manager for the development, design, procurement, build and testing of an industrial melting furnace for processing waste slag (developed business case - CAPEX/OPEX, flowsheets etc...).</li>
        <li>I lead and oversee the pyrometallurgy and prototyping lab. I research, design and organize the build of prototype recycling and furnace technologies, I organized the renovation and development of a new pyrometallurgical lab space, and I manage co-op students.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Materials Engineering Intern</h3>
    <h4>Apple Inc. (Jan 2022-Aug 2022)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>De-risked a $100M project for a new iPhone glass coating material by identifying the cause of a consistent decrease in glass strength; through building statistical models in JMP, designing experiments for supplying vendors, failure analysis, cross-functional team collaboration,and process inference.</li>
        <li>Designed, coded, trained, and tested a computer vision model using a convolutional neural network to identify iPhone product failure modes.</li>
        <li>Identified root cause of newly observed failures from in-field products, and product in development, using JMP and statistical models I built to process large datasets.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Hybrid Materials Intern</h3>
    <h4>MSE Department McMaster University (May 2021 - Aug 2021)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Designed and executed experiments to measure the mechanical strength and understand failure mechanisms of 3D printed honeycombs with geometry defects.</li>
        <li>Investigated the energy absorption properties of thin functionally graded sheet steels for automotive light-weighting applications.</li>
        <li>Continued research in a senior thesis that found unique failure mechanisms in geometrically unique honeycombs. Presented research in a plenary talk with a conference publication.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Materials and Process Engineering Intern</h3>
    <h4>Collins Aerospacce Landing Systems (Sep 2019 - Mar 2020)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Conducted failure analyses (investigations - four) involving metallography and SEM examination on in-service landing gear parts, presented weekly updates to stakeholders. On two separate investigations, conclusions from my investigations ensured a fleets of 30 and 200 planes correspondingly could remain flying.</li>
        <li>Designed experiments and heat treatments for a novel high strength titanium alloy for additive manufacturing of large landing gear components.</li>
    </ul>
