<h1>about me</h1>
<p>I grew up on the east coast of Canada; lucky to be raised by two wonderful parents. I am an only child, and when friends find that out for the first time, the next thing I usually hear is: "AH! NOW it makes sense".
</p>
<p>I'm still trying to make sense of the "it"</p>

<p>Now I live with my girlfriend and dog in Vancouver. A place we chose, to be near the landscapes we love: mountains, the ocean, and beaches. Dino especially loves the beach. Doesn't like the water, but loves the beach.</p>

<p>That's enough for now...</p>
